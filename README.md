# Current Mod Description (As Shown on Steam):
Currently, this mod is essentially just an updated version of the ***"Less Event Spam"*** mod by the wonderful **Night** and **Pingvin**. Please see the original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2750102888&searchtext=less+even

# What It Does
This mod, as it's predecessor did, simply marks multiple events as hidden. Turning them from character events and large popups to hidden ones that will still be logged and sent to the interface under the hood but won't show up in the players face time and time again. To be clear: **No Events are Removed Nor Stopped, But Simply Hidden.**

# Current Events Affected
* A Seduction Scheme at Court: Spymaster notifies player of ongoing scheme against character at court. 
* Schemer Discovered: Your spymaster has discovered the schemer, but you can't take action. If you can imprison the schemer (i.e. they're your courtier/vassal), you still get the event.
* Prisoner Release Acceptance; Since you already know whether your prisoner will accept their release conditions, there's no point in giving you a large event popup.
* Marriage Accepted Letter: Just like Prisoner release, we know when we send offer, so no need to get a large reply.
* A Snake at Court: Attempted seduction of courtier & ongoing affair between courtier and someone else. Still uses the games random insults that Less Event Spam mod used...may change in the future.

# Compatibility
**This mod overwrites the following files in their entirety as it's the only way to ensure the events are actually affected and overridden.** *If there's an alternative let me know*

character_interaction_events.txt
marriage_interaction_events.txt
hostile_scheme_discovery_events.txt
seduce_scheme_outcome_events.txt

# Disclaimer
**I'm completely new to modding so it might take me a bit to patch bugs when they are found.
I do plan on making further updates to this mod however and plan on adding more events. If you have suggestions, please add them to the comments and/or open a discussion.**
